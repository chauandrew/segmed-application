# segmed-application

A webapp that displays images as its main feature. Photos can be flagged, and a photo's state is persisted. Flagged photos have a dark border and unflagged photos have a light border. Check out the site [here](http://segmed-env.eba-gi24nmgh.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)!

The site is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and features a Flask/Jinja2 backend server with a PostgreSQL database. The project uses Bootstrap4 for styling. 

The photos on the site are taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), and are of Yosemite National Park.
